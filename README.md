# hello-world
in this awesome repository i will show you how to make an amazing "hello world" app

Hello, my name is David, im from Colombia and i'm a civil engineer. at this point of my life i feel tired
of the professional path i chose. I don't like civil engineering and i'm trying to make a change.
Since i saw programming fundamentals in the university i though it was a really awesome subject.
So, right now im trying to learn how to program, my dream is to be a freelancer developer...anyways, 
i'm sure nobody will read this but...thanks!
